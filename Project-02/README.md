Given:
* A set of n entities O = {o<sub>1</sub>,o<sub>2</sub>,...,o<sub>n</sub>} at given points pi= (p<sub>ik</sub>,k=1,...,s) of R<sup>s</sup> for i=1,...,n
* A fixed number c of clusters. The objective is to find c cluster centres located in points z<sub>j</sub> âˆˆ R<sup>s</sup> for j=1,...,c in order to minimize

where the binary variables w<sub>ij</sub> express the assignment of the entity o<sub>i</sub> to the cluster j.

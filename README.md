# Metaheuristics (INF1306) Projects

This repository will hold the source code, setup instructions and results.

*"This course aims to introduce tools and technics of combinatory optimization for solving problems of great scale. Such problems have copious industrial and practical applications, in areas such as transport, logistics, production, finances and machine learning. For the most part of these problems, there is no good optimal solution in large scale instances. However, a wide variety of 'heuristics' are able to generate good solutions. Developing good heuristics require as much insight as practice. During this course, the students will get to know heuristic and metaheuristic technics, such as simulated annealing, tabu search, 'genetic algorithms', ant farm colony algorithms, as well as plenty of tips to make these work in practice."

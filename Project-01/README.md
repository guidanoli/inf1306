# First Project - GVRP

## Building the application :gear:

**Disclaimer**: Unfortunately, this application can only be compiled on POSIX systems. I have tried to compile it in CYGWIN but it fails to link the dynamic library correctly.

In order to build, simply run on your preffered terminal the `make` command. This will download any dependecies if necessary and then compile the source code.

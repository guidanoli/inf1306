# First Project - GVRP

This is the version of the same project but in Java for portability reasons and due to the lack of useful data structures in the C standard library like in the Java standard library. Also, Java offers an almost native testing environment (JUnit), which C does not offer (and the reason for the creation of the LWCTL).
